# moodle-mootyper-modified
Modifications for the MooTyper-Plugin to make learning the 10-finger-writing in Moodle more appealing. 

-------------------

### Plans for this repository:

This Repository will include __styles__ for a better appearance in the Mootyper-Plugin. 

Also there will be __scripts__ to reward students for their learning progress e.g. by using confetti.

> Maybe it could be usefull to build free badges and a whole finished learning course with all that modifications.
